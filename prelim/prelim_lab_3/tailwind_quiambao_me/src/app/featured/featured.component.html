        <p class="px-10 pb-3 w-[95%]">Ei was born into the Yashiro Commission, one of the most powerful clans in Inazuma. She displayed exceptional talent from a young age, particularly in martial arts and leadership. As she grew older, Ei became determined to protect her people and uphold the ideals of eternity and eternity. She believed that the Vision Hunt Decree, which confiscated Visions from the citizens, was necessary for the stability of Inazuma. Ei ascended to the position of Shogun, becoming the ruler of Inazuma. She wielded the Musou Isshin, a powerful Electro polearm, and her Vision allowed her to channel immense energy. Raiden Shogun is not just a ruler; she is also the vessel for the Electro Archon, Baal. Baal’s consciousness resides within her, granting her immense strength but also burdening her with the weight of immortality. She grapples with the responsibility of maintaining order in Inazuma while bearing the loneliness and isolation that come with her divine status.</p>

        <p class="px-10 pb-3 w-[95%]">Raiden Shogun wields a unique Vision—one that allows her to channel immense Electro power. Her combat abilities are formidable, especially when using her Elemental Burst, Transcendence: Baleful Omen. She is also associated with the Raiden Guuji Clan, a group of warriors who serve her faithfully. Their loyalty is unwavering, even as they witness the suffering caused by the Vision Hunt Decree.</p>
